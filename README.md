# Movie_recomendation_system
**Overview**
This project is a content-based movie recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on their preferences. It leverages machine learning techniques and metadata from movies such as genres, cast, and plot summaries to provide personalized recommendations. The system features an interactive and user-friendly front-end built with Streamlit.

**Features**

**Personalized Recommendations**: Suggests movies based on user preferences and viewing history.

**Interactive Interface**: Users can interact with the system via a sleek and responsive Streamlit UI.

**Real-Time Suggestions**: Provides instant recommendations after user input.

**Content-Based Filtering**: Uses movie metadata for tailored suggestions.

**Dataset**
The system is trained on a dataset containing:

Movie titles
Genres
Cast and crew information
Plot summaries
The dataset can be sourced from platforms like **TMDb**, or you can use a preprocessed dataset.

**Techniques Used**
Content-Based Filtering:

**Attributes Used**: Genres, cast, crew, and plot summaries.

**Vectorization**: Converts text data into numerical format using Count Vectorizer.

**Cosine Similarity**: Measures the similarity between movies based on vectorized features.

**User Interaction:**

Input: Users can select a movie from the dropdown or enter its name.
Output: Displays a list of similar movies with posters or brief details.



**How It Works**
Data Preprocessing: The system processes movie metadata, including genres, cast, and plot.
Vectorization: Text features are vectorized using Count Vectorizer.
Similarity Calculation: The system calculates cosine similarity between movies.
Recommendation Display: Based on user input, the app lists similar movies.
